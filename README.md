# Roguelike

My first roguelike (and my first game) back from 2012. Developed specifically for Samsung Galaxy S Plus.
Main goal - multiresolution support.

### Current features
- Full multiresolution support (ui elements needs to be tweaked).
- Only russian language support.
- Can be completed (game mechanics needs to be balanced).

### Future plans
1. Support different screen sizes.
2. Overall refactoring.
3. Refactor and complete existing gameplay mechanics.
4. Refactor and complete current content (items, enemies, rooms).
